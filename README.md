# rngpredict
Right now, it's not great for predicting numbers besides those generated by MSVC, but it's getting there. I'm serious about improving the code quality too, I *swear*. 


My Lua(JIT) version will beat this in every metric except maintainability, including accuracy, speed, and memory usage, and will do so long into the foreseeable future. I don't know how to optimize for Java particularly well, but if you do, please pitch in code.
